ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project delivers an end-to-end temperature forecasting system for U.S. cities using ~3 million daily records (1995â€“2019). The pipeline covers data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and interactive visualization.

We evaluate five forecasting approaches:

ARIMA & SARIMA â€“ Classic time series models for linear trends and seasonality.

Random Forest & XGBoost â€“ Ensemble tree methods capturing complex nonlinear patterns.

LSTM â€“ Deep learning for long-term temporal dependencies.

Key features:

Engineered features â€“ Lag values, rolling averages, seasonal indicators, and geographic encodings.

Model evaluation â€“ RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² across cities, climates, and seasons.

Interactive dashboards â€“ Compare forecasts to actual data and explore error metrics spatially and seasonally.

Use Cases:

Agriculture â€“ Protect crops from frost and plan harvests.

Energy â€“ Balance supply and demand during weather extremes.

Urban Planning â€“ Prepare for heat waves or cold spells.
